### Debugging
- **Errors are normal**: It's totally normal to run into errors; both beginners and pros encounter them.
- **Three Strategies to Debug**:
    1. Write clean code
    2. Use documentation
    3. Read error messages

#### Debugging: Write Clean Code
Clean code is more readable and makes spotting errors easier.

```html
<html>
	<body>
	  <p>clean</p>
	  <p>code</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Debugging: Use Documentation
Hover over an HTML tag that's not working to find a link to documentation.

### HTML Review
- **HTML Structure**:
    - It adds structure to web pages.
    - It uses tags to create different elements on a webpage.

```html
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Yay, coding!</p>
  <button>Click here.</button>
</body>
```

### CSS Review
- **CSS Styling**:
    - It adds style to web pages.
    - Choose a selector, property, and value.

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```


### Key Takeaways
- Writing clean, error-free code is essential, but encountering errors is a normal part of the coding process.
- Debugging involves strategies such as writing clean code, reading error messages, and consulting documentation.
- HTML and CSS are foundational technologies for creating web pages.

Happy coding!
